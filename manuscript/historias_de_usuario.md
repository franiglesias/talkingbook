2001: Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:[5]
The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts;
The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;
The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.
